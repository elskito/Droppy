✨ New Features
- Quickshare is now removable: disable it like any other extension to hide from menus and quick actions

🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed floating basket revealing too early when cursor approaches edge (now requires actual sliver contact)
- Fixed Quick Actions bar collapsing prematurely when drag ends near the bar
- Fixed reorder drag position jumping when items swap positions

⚡ Performance
- Context menus now use cached sharing services and app lists for faster rendering
- Bulk operations (clear all, remove selected, move to shelf) now skip animations for instant feedback
- Drag preview stack limited to 5 visible items for snappier multi-select drags

🔧 Improvements
- Simplified floating basket peek animation (removed unnecessary 3D transforms)
- Basket now preserves position when auto-hiding to edge (no more vertical centering jumps)
- Removed experimental "Notch Height" adjustment feature
- Folder drag previews now use custom folder icon with correct pinned state
