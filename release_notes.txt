# Droppy v2.6.6 🩹

Final stability patch for the Notch Window.

### 🛠 Fixes
- **Crash Resolved**: Removed the fade animation when hiding/showing the notch in full-screen apps. This eliminates a complex `CoreAnimation` transaction crash ("NSDisplayCycleFlush") that affected some users.
- **Improved**: The notch now snaps instantly to hidden/visible state when entering full-screen apps, which is safer and cleaner.

This addresses the `stepTransactionFlush` crash log newly reported. 🛡️
