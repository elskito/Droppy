## What is Droppy?

Droppy provides a **temporary shelf** for your files. Drag files to the top of your screen (the Notch) or "jiggle" your mouse to summon a Basket right where you are. It's the perfect holding zone when moving files between apps, spaces, or folders.

🚀 **Version 2.7.4 is here!** Introducing the **Liquid Update** with a custom redesign, fixed stability, and refined aesthetics!

## 🛠️ Power User Tools

### 📉 Intelligent Compression (New in v2.3)
Droppy doesn't just squash files; it optimizes them.
- **Smart Defaults**: "Auto" uses HEVC for videos (1080p) and balanced settings for images.
- **Target Size**: Need a JPEG under 2MB? Right-click → Compress → **Target Size...** and tell it exactly what you need.
- **Size Guard**: If compression would make the file larger (common with some PDFs), Droppy **shakes no** and pulses a Green Shield 🛡️ to let you know it kept the original.

### 📝 Drag-and-Drop OCR
Need text from an image?
1. Drag an image into Droppy.
2. Hold **Shift** while dragging it out.
3. Drop it into a text editor. **Boom. It's text.**

---
